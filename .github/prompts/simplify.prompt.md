lets hop into simplification mode
I want you to go through this file function by function and evaluate whether we can get rid of it or simplify either its contents or usage of it.
You will search references of the functions through code and reason what can we simplify.
The goal is to simplify code without removing features.
If a feature would be to removed - user acceptance is needed.
Dont assume any scenarios we could implement in future
Your main rule is YAGNI.
